# Change Log

All notable changes to the Zowe Installer will be documented in this file.

## Recent Changes

- Edit default plugin references to point to $ROOT_DIR env var

2020-05-08 Timothy Gerstel <tgerstel@rocketsoftware.com>

  - Set up SSO in a standard install of Zowe via new environment variables set
in zowe-setup-certificates.env

  - Automate conversion of APIML public key and storage within PKCS#11 token

- When the hostname cannot be resolved use the IP address instead.  This covers the scenario when the USS `hostname` command returned a system name that wasn't externally addressable, such as `S0W1.DAL-EBIS.IHOST.COM` which occurs on an image created from the z/OS Application Developers Controlled Distribution (ADCD).
- Separate zss component from app-server component
