# Prepare Certificate

To run test case of external certificate, need to upload the `tests/installation/src/__tests__/extended/certificates/generate-dummy-certificates.sh` script to target server, execute and generate dummy certificate and CA.

Example:
```
generate-dummy-certificates.sh my-domain-name.com
```
