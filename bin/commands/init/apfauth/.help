This command will APF authorize load library for you.

NOTE: You may need proper permission to write to target procedure library.

These Zowe YAML configurations showing with sample values are required:

```
zowe:
  setup:
    mvs:
      hlq: IBMUSER.ZWE
      authLoadlib: IBMUSER.ZWE.CUST.ZWESALL
      authPluginLib: IBMUSER.ZWE.CUST.ZWESAPL
```

- `zowe.setup.mvs.hlq` shows where the `SZWEAUTH` data set is installed.
- `zowe.setup.mvs.authLoadlib` is the user custom APF LOADLIB. This field is
  optional. If it's not defined, `SZWEAUTH` under HLQ will be APF authorized.
- `zowe.setup.mvs.authPluginLib` is the user custom APF PLUGINLIB.
  You can install Zowe ZIS plugins into this load library.
