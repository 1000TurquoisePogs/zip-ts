This command will initialize Zowe Cross Memory for you. The actions are:

- copy Zowe Cross Memory parmlib member `ZWESIP00` into your target parmlib,
- copy Zowe Cross Memory started tasks `ZWESISTC` and `ZWESASTC` to your target
  procedure library.

NOTE: You may need proper permission to write to target procedure library.

These Zowe YAML configurations showing with sample values are required:

```
zowe:
  setup:
    logDirectory: /my/log/directory
    mvs:
      hlq: IBMUSER.ZWE
      proclib: USER.PROCLIB
      parmlib: IBMUSER.PARMLIB
```

- `zowe.setup.mvs.parmlib` shows what is the target PARMLIB.
- `zowe.setup.mvs.hlq` shows where the original STCs are.
- `zowe.setup.mvs.proclib` shows what is the target PROCLIB.
