This command will generate certificate used by Zowe services.

These Zowe YAML configurations showing with sample values are required:

```
zowe:
  setup:
    certificate:
      type: PKCS12
      dname:
        caCommonName:
        commonName:
        orgUnit:
        org:
        locality:
        state:
        country:
      validity: 3650
      pkcs12:
        directory: /global/zowe/keystore
        name: localhost
        password: password
        caAlias: local_ca
        caPassword: local_ca_password
      san:
        - zos.my-company.com
        - internal-lpar1.zos.my-company.com
        - internal-lpar2.zos.my-company.com
        - internal-lpar3.zos.my-company.com
  externalDomains:
   - zos.my-company.com
  verifyCertificates: STRICT
zOSMF:
  host: zosmf.my-company.com
  port: 443
```

- `zowe.setup.certificate.type` is the type of certificate. Valid values are
  "PKCS12" or "JCERACFKS".
- `zowe.setup.certificate.dname` is the distinguished name of the certificate.
  You can define `caCommonName`, `commonName`, `orgUnit`, `org`, `locality`,
  `state`, and / or `country`. These configurations are optional.
- `zowe.setup.certificate.validity` is the validity days of the certificate.
  This is optional.
- `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.directory` is the directory where you plan to
  store the PKCS12 keystore and truststore. This is required if
  `zowe.setup.certificate.type` is `PKCS12`.
- You can also define `name`, `password`, `caAlias` and `caPassword` under
  `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12` to customized keystore and truststore. These
  configurations are optional, but it is recommended to update them from
  default values.
- `zowe.setup.certificate.san` is the `Subject Alternative Name`(s) of the
  certificate if they are different from `zowe.externalDomains`.
- `zOSMF.host` and `zOSMF.port` is the z/OSMF service information. This is
  required if you are using z/OSMF as authentication service.
- `zowe.verifyCertificates` indicates how Zowe should validate the certificate
  of services registered under Zowe APIML. Valid values are "STRICT",
  "NONSTRICT" or "DISABLED". If this is "STRICT", this command will try to
  validate the z/OSMF service certificate if z/OSMF is defined.
