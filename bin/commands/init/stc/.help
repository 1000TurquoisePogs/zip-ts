This command will copy Zowe started tasks `ZWESLSTC`, `ZWESISTC`, `ZWESASTC` to
your target procedure library.

NOTE: You may need proper permission to write to target procedure library.

These Zowe YAML configurations showing with sample values are required:

```
zowe:
  setup:
    mvs:
      hlq: IBMUSER.ZWE
      proclib: USER.PROCLIB
```

- `zowe.setup.mvs.hlq` shows where the `SZWESAMP` data set is installed,
- `zowe.setup.mvs.proclib` shows what is the target procedure library.
