This command will copy Zowe started tasks `ZWESLSTC`, `ZWESISTC` and 
`ZWESASTC` to your target procedure library.

NOTE: You may need proper permission to write to target procedure library.

These Zowe YAML configurations showing with sample values are required:

```
zowe:
  setup:
    logDirectory: /my/log/directory
    mvs:
      hlq: IBMUSER.ZWE
      proclib: USER.PROCLIB
```

The `zowe.setup.mvs.hlq` shows where the original STCs are, and the
`zowe.setup.mvs.proclib` shows where is the target PROCLIB.
