After you extract Zowe convenience build, you can run this command to install
MVS data sets.

If you are using SMPE build, you can skip this command since MVS data sets are
already prepared during SMPE install.

These Zowe YAML configurations showing with sample values are required:

```
zowe:
  setup:
    logDirectory: /my/log/directory
    mvs:
      hlq: IBMUSER.ZWE
```

Expected outputs:

- Will create these data sets under `zowe.setup.mvs.hlq` definition:
  * `SZWEAUTH` contains few Zowe load modules (++PROGRAM).
  * `SZWESAMP` contains several sample configurations.
  * `SZWECLIB` contains few utilities used by Zowe.
