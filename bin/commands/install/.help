After you extract Zowe convenience build, you can run this command to install
MVS datasets.

If you are using SMPE build, you can ignore this command since MVS datasets are
already prepared by SMPE install.

These Zowe YAML configurations showing with sample values are required:

```
zowe:
  install:
    logDirectory: /my/log/directory
    mvs:
      hlq: IBMUSER.ZWE
```
