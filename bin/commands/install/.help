After you extract Zowe convenience build, you can run this command to install
MVS datasets.

If you are using SMPE build, you can ignore this command since MVS datasets are
already prepared by SMPE install.

These Zowe YAML configurations are required by this command:

```
zowe:
  install:
    logDirectory: ${USER}/logs
    mvs:
      hlq: IBMUSER.ZWE
      loadlib: SZWEAUTH
      parmlib: SZWESAMP
```
